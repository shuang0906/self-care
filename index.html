                <p> Earlier this year, an event unfolded that profoundly impacted my perception of care,
                    labor, and rest. On January 6<sup>th</sup>, there was an attempted coup in the United States,
                    a day that will be etched in history for its chaos and turmoil. The following day,

                    captured my attention and resonated deeply with me. It depicted New Jersey
                    Representative Andy Kim, immersed in the quiet yet powerful act of cleaning the debris
                    left in the Capitol building. This image struck a chord within me, illustrating a form of care
                    that
                    is often overlooked—care that is not as visible or recognized as other forms of
                    public intervention.

                <p>Representative Kim's actions in the aftermath of chaos were a poignant demonstration
                    of civic pride and engagement, a stark contrast to the destructive behaviors witnessed.
                    This act of cleaning, an invisible form of labor, sparked a reflection on the nature of
                    care and its various manifestations.</p>

                <p>My thoughts then turned to the work of Mierle Laderman Ukeles, a performance
                    artist who, in the 1970s, explored the concept of maintenance as a form of care
                    through her <em>Maintenance</em> art series. One of her works,

                    , vividly illustrates the labor of cleaning, making the often invisible work of maintenance
                    visible and recognized as a form of artistic expression. This concept challenges
                    us to reconsider what we value as significant contributions to
                    society and what we choose to acknowledge as noteworthy.

                    nature of care, often associated with femininity and overlooked in the broader discourse
                    on labor and artistic value.

                <p>In reflecting on these various expressions of care, from the meticulous cleaning of a public building to the artistic
                    exploration of maintenance and the advocacy for rest, we are prompted to reconsider our own relationship with care,
                    labor, and rest. What does care look like in our lives? How do we value and recognize the different forms of labor
                    that sustain our communities? And how do we prioritize rest as an integral component of care, acknowledging its
                    power to
                    heal and rejuvenate?</p>

                <p> The conversation on pleasure—its permissibility, its expression, and its inherent value—remains crucial. It challenges us to consider the diverse ways in which individuals and communities navigate, claim, and express pleasure amidst varying degrees of acceptance and condemnation. This exploration not only sheds light on the personal and collective experiences of pleasure but also underscores the resilience and defiance of those who assert their right to joy in the face of restrictive norms 
                    and expectations.</p>

				<div class="title chapter-3"><h1>Warfare:</h1> <h2>Communities of Care</h2></div>

				<p> In my reflections on the essence of care within and beyond our personal spheres, a compelling narrative emerges, one that transcends the mere act of caring for ourselves or our immediate surroundings. This journey delves into the profound realms of community-based care, exploring what it truly means to nurture not only ourselves but also the 
                    communities we inhabit.</p>

                <p> Let's consider the vibrant tapestry of the 1970s New York art scene, a period marked by a surge of art activism. Among the notable collectives was a group of black women artists, a collective that eventually came to be known as 
                    "Where We At" Black Women Artists, Inc. (WWA).&nbsp;&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label>

                    </span>
                    Their artistic endeavors were deeply intertwined with social activism 
                    and consciousness raising, embodying a unique blend of artistic creation and community care.</p>

                <p>These artists faced substantial challenges, juggling their artistic pursuits with domestic responsibilities such as housekeeping and child-rearing—tasks traditionally imposed on women. The collective's essence was not solely about artistic collaboration but also about fostering a support network, providing mutual assistance in child care, housekeeping, and emotional support. This communal support system was vital, enabling them to focus on their art while managing life's daily demands.
                </p>

                <p>Consider the work of Faith Ringgold, a pioneering figure in this movement, who used her art to challenge societal norms and advocate for black women's visibility.

                    Netflix calling your name.
                    That’s where I come in…
                    Let me guide you through virtual myofascial release and yoga classes, so you can get a massage every day, maintain
