                <p> Earlier this year, an event unfolded that profoundly impacted my perception of care,
                    labor, and rest. On January 6<sup>th</sup>, there was an attempted coup in the United States,
                    a day that will be etched in history for its chaos and turmoil. The following day,

                    captured my attention and resonated deeply with me. It depicted New Jersey
                    Representative Andy Kim, immersed in the quiet yet powerful act of cleaning the debris
                    left in the Capitol building. This image struck a chord within me, illustrating a form of care
                    that
                    is often overlooked—care that is not as visible or recognized as other forms of
                    public intervention.

                <p>Representative Kim's actions in the aftermath of chaos were a poignant demonstration
                    of civic pride and engagement, a stark contrast to the destructive behaviors witnessed.
                    This act of cleaning, an invisible form of labor, sparked a reflection on the nature of
                    care and its various manifestations.</p>

                <p>My thoughts then turned to the work of Mierle Laderman Ukeles, a performance
                    artist who, in the 1970s, explored the concept of maintenance as a form of care
                    through her <em>Maintenance</em> art series. One of her works,

                    , vividly illustrates the labor of cleaning, making the often invisible work of maintenance
                    visible and recognized as a form of artistic expression. This concept challenges
                    us to reconsider what we value as significant contributions to
                    society and what we choose to acknowledge as noteworthy.

                <p>In reflecting on these various expressions of care, from the meticulous cleaning of a public building to the artistic
                    exploration of maintenance and the advocacy for rest, we are prompted to reconsider our own relationship with care,
                    labor, and rest. What does care look like in our lives? How do we value and recognize the different forms of labor
                    that sustain our communities? And how do we prioritize rest as an integral component of care, acknowledging its
                    power to
                    heal and rejuvenate?</p>

                <p> The conversation on pleasure—its permissibility, its expression, and its inherent value—remains crucial. It challenges us to consider the diverse ways in which individuals and communities navigate, claim, and express pleasure amidst varying degrees of acceptance and condemnation. This exploration not only sheds light on the personal and collective experiences of pleasure but also underscores the resilience and defiance of those who assert their right to joy in the face of restrictive norms 
                    and expectations.</p>

				<p> In my reflections on the essence of care within and beyond our personal spheres, a compelling narrative emerges, one that transcends the mere act of caring for ourselves or our immediate surroundings. This journey delves into the profound realms of community-based care, exploring what it truly means to nurture not only ourselves but also the 
                    communities we inhabit.</p>

                <p> Let's consider the vibrant tapestry of the 1970s New York art scene, a period marked by a surge of art activism. Among the notable collectives was a group of black women artists, a collective that eventually came to be known as 
                    "Where We At" Black Women Artists, Inc. (WWA).&nbsp;&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label>

                    </span>
                    Their artistic endeavors were deeply intertwined with social activism 
                    and consciousness raising, embodying a unique blend of artistic creation and community care.</p>

                <p>These artists faced substantial challenges, juggling their artistic pursuits with domestic responsibilities such as housekeeping and child-rearing—tasks traditionally imposed on women. The collective's essence was not solely about artistic collaboration but also about fostering a support network, providing mutual assistance in child care, housekeeping, and emotional support. This communal support system was vital, enabling them to focus on their art while managing life's daily demands.

                <p>Consider the work of Faith Ringgold, a pioneering figure in this movement, who used her art to challenge societal norms and advocate for black women's visibility.

				<h2>Biblia pauperum</h2>
				<p>Biblia pauperum, a Latin term for “pauper’s Bible”—Bible of the poor—
				refers to block books created in medieval Europe, typically in the 14th
				and 15th centuries, which visualized the correspondences between the Old
				and New Testaments. They consisted mainly of a series of illustrations,
				often accompanied by short explanatory texts written in vernacular
				languages. This popular format, that could be compared to contemporary
				comics, was used by the minor clergy as a visual help for prayers and
				reflections. <sub>(“Biblia Pauperum.,” n.d.)</sub></p>
				<h2>Book History</h2>
				<p>Book history is an interdisciplinary field of study at the crossroad
				of textual scholarship, codicology, bibliography, philology,
				palaeography, art history, social history and cultural history, that
				began to be recognized as an academic discipline in the 1980s.<br>
				A pioneering scholar of this field is Robert Darnton, an American
				historian who wrote extensively on the history of books and reading in
				France and Europe during the modern era, and defined his discipline as
				“the social and cultural history of communication by print”. In his
				essay <em>What is the History of Books</em>? (1982), he develops a model
				that will become foundational within the field, a “communication
				circuit” comprising six links forming a dynamic loop; author - publisher
				– printer – shipper – seller – reader. By considering the full scope of
				this circuit, he encourages scholars to examine the book as an object
				and a cultural artifact, by analyzing both its material aspects and its
				social, economical and cultural significance in a transnational context.
				<sub>(Davidjgary, 2013)</sub></p>
				<h2>Edit-a-thon</h2>
				<p>An edit-a-thon (or “editathon”) is an event, or a series of events,
				during which people work together—online or in person—to edit, improve,
				expand, or create wiki entries. They can be organized in very structured
				or very informal ways, around a wide range of themes and topics—women’s
				history, environmental issues, vernacular cultures and histories—and
				generally about subjects that are underrepresented on the platform.
				<sub>(<em>Edit-a-thon</em>, 2022)</sub></p>
				<h2>Herstory</h2>
				<p>Herstory [from <em>her</em> + <em>story</em>] is a term coined by
				U.-S. feminist activists during the 1970s, to designate a version of
				history written from a feminist perspective, often with a focus on the
				experiences, contributions and achievement of women, which are usually
				overlooked in traditional historical accounts. Herstory is thus
				contrasted with history, which although derived from the Greek and Latin
				<em>historia</em>, and not the contraction of <em>his</em> +
				<em>story</em>, is inherently male-centered. <sub>(Colman,
				2008)</sub></p>
				<h2>Intersectionnality</h2>
				<p>“The term ‘intersectionality’ has its roots in Black feminist
				activism, and was originally coined by American critical legal race
				scholar Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw in 1989. Crenshaw used the term
				intersectionality to refer to the double discrimination of racism and
				sexism faced by Black women, critiquing the ‘single-axis framework that
				is dominant in antidiscrimination law.. feminist theory and anti-racist
				politics’ for its focus on the experiences of the most privileged
				members of subordinate groups. (…)<br>
				Crenshaw provided the following definition of intersectionality:
				‘Intersectionality is a metaphor for understanding the ways that
				multiple forms of inequality or disadvantage sometimes compound
				themselves and create obstacles that often are not understood among
				conventional ways of thinking.’” <sub>(“Using Intersectionality to
				Understand Structural Inequality in Scotland: Evidence Synthesis”,
				2022)</sub></p>
				<h2>Matrix of domination</h2>
				<p>The matrix of domination, resonating with Kimberlé Crenshaw’s concept
				of intersectionality, is coined by Patricia Collins in <em>Black
				Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of
				Empowerment</em> (1990), to show how societal power relations are
				organized by four interconnected domains (structural, hegemonic,
				disciplinary and interpersonal domains). She thus explains how
				capitalism, white supremacy and heteropatriarchy are interlocking
				systems of oppression, which are experienced simultaneously by the
				individuals who exist at their intersections, connecting (among other),
				race, gender, class, sexuality or religion. <sub>(Collins, 1990 ;
				Costanza-Chock, 2008)</sub></p>
				<h2>Mimeograph</h2>
				<p>“A mimeograph, also called stencil duplicator, was a printing machine
				used in the mid-20th century to produce copies of documents or images.
				It worked by using a stencil, which was placed on a rotating drum, to
				transfer ink onto paper. The machine was manually operated, with the
				operator cranking the drum to create the copies. Mimeographs were
				commonly used in schools and businesses before modern photocopiers
				became widely available.” <sub>(“Mimeograph | printing technology”,
				n.d.)</sub></p>
				<h2>Risograph</h2>
				<p>The Risograph (or riso-duplicator), is a low-cost, high-volume and
				high-speed printer. Released in Japan in 1980 by the Riso Kagaku
				Corporation, it was initially intended for offices, schools, churches
				and political parties, and will later know a resurgence in activist and
				artistic circles, due to its affordability, as well as its bold and
				textured colours. The underlying technology is close to the mimeograph,
				and uses a digitally produced stencil, through which ink is pushed.
				<sub>(<em>What Is a Risograph?</em>, n.d.)</sub></p>
				<h2>Samizdat</h2>
				<p>“Samizdat, (from Russian <em>sam</em>, “self,” and
				<em>izdatelstvo</em>, “publishing”), literature secretly written,
				copied, and circulated in the former Soviet Union and usually critical
				of practices of the Soviet government. (…) Samizdat publications
				expanded their focus beyond freedom of expression to a critique
				of many aspects of official Soviet policies and activities, including
				ideologies, culture, law, economic policy, historiography, and treatment
				of religions and ethnic minorities. Because of the government’s strict
				monopoly on presses, photocopiers, and other such devices, samizdat
				publications typically took the form of carbon copies of typewritten
				sheets and were passed by hand from reader to reader.” <sub>(“Samizdat |
				Soviet Literature,” n.d.)</sub></p>
				<h2>Second wave feminism</h2>
				<p>“A shorthand reference for the politically active form of feminism
				that emerged in the US and elsewhere in the 1960s. It was neither a
				unified nor a homogeneous movement, but it did of course have a common
				goal, however disparately this was conceived, namely the equality of the
				sexes. It was born of the recognition that in spite of the considerable
				advances of the retrospectively christened First Wave of feminism, women
				had still not achieved genuine equality with men in every facet of life.
				Its starting point, in the US, was Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique
				(1963), which argues that women are trapped in a system that denies them
				self-identity as women and demands they find fulfilment through their
				husbands and children. Later writers, particularly those identifying as
				radical feminists, would use the term patriarchy as a shorthand for this
				systemic subordination of women at the level of culture itself, rather
				than individual men.” <sub>(“Second Wave Feminism,” n.d.)</sub></p>
